/**
 * This entity is the digital representation of a voters right to vote.
 * Only the voter knows his secret voterToken that he received via {@link org.doogie.liquido.rest.VoteRestController#getVoterToken(AreaModel, String, Boolean)}.
 * Only that voter can proof that he has a right to vote by presenting his voterToken which hashes to
 * the stored value.
 *
 * When a voter requests a voterToken for an area , then the server calculates two values:
 * 1. voterToken  = hash(user.email, userSecret, serverSecret, area)   This voterToken is returned to the voter.
 * 2. rightToVote = hash(voterToken, serverSecret)    The rightToVote is anonymously stored on the server.
 *
 * When a user wants to cast a vote, then he sends his voterToken for this area.
 * Then the server checks if he already knows the corresponding rightToVote value.
 * If yes, then the casted vote is valid and will be counted.
