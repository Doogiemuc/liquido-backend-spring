 * 2. checksumModel = hash(voterToken, secretSeed)
 *
 * Only the checksumModel is (anonomously) stored on the server. And

 * When a user wants to cast a vote, then he sends his voterToken for this area.
 * Then the server checks if he already knows the corresponding checksumModel.
 * If yes, then the casted vote is valid and will be counted.
