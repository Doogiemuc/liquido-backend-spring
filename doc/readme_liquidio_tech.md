# LIQUIDO - Tech Guide

This is the technical documentation of the LQIUIDO backend. The backend is is implemented in Java SPRING BOOT.

# Data Model

## Process Model from an idea to a Law

 - At first there is an short rough idea. (NEW_IDEA)
 - When an idea reaches its quorum, then it becomes a proposal. (NEW_PROPOSAL)
 - Alternative proposals can be added to that initial proposal. (NEW_PROPOSAL)
   But they first need to reach a certain quorum too, before they can be voted upon.
 - Each proposal can be discussed. Comments can be voted up and down. (ELABORATION)
 - n days after the initial proposal reached its quorum, then the voting phase starts.
   All competing proposals can be voted upon. (VOTING_PHASE)
 - The winning proposal becomes a law (LAW) and all other proposals are (DECLINED)

## Wording

"idea"          := rough and short
"proposal"      := reached its quorum
"law"           := won a vote

# Use Cases

## Login

participant WebApp
participant Backend

WebApp -> Backend: /auth/requestSmsToken?mobile={mobile}
note over Backend: create and store OneTimeToken
Backend --> Mobile: Send 6-digit token via SMS

Mobile -> WebApp: Enter token from SMS

WebApp -> Backend: /auth/loginWithSmsToken?mobile={mobile}&token={token}
note over Backend 
  validate OneTimeToken
  then delete it, if valid
end note
Backend -> WebApp: return JWT

note over WebApp: storeJwt()

WebApp -> Backend: send authenticated requests with JWT in header

## Backlog / User Stories

## Global configuration / settings

   - number of likes that are necessary to move an idea onto the table
   - number of supporters that are necessary for a proposal to reach its quorum

## "Profile" default values for new polls

  - when does a voting phase / poll start
    a) n days after the initial proposal reached its quorum
    b) when there are at least n alternative proposals (with quorum each)
    c) manually started by the admin
  - duration of elaboration phase
  - duration of voting phase

### Ideas

 - I "Like to discuss" an idea
 - Move an idea onto the table when the necessary quorum is reached.

### Laws

 - Edit the description of a law proposal
 - Add a suggestion to a law
 - Up/Down-vote a suggestion.
 - Sort competing proposals into vote order (XXL)

 ### Voter Token

 A voter token is the digital representation of your right to vote.
 You can request a voter token for every area.

 You need a voterToken to
  - cast your vote
  - check for an existing ballot in a given poll
  - assign, edit or remove a proxy
  - accept delegation requests
  - become a public proxy
  - get number of real delegations to your checksum

Get proxy info for an area is possible without a voterToken


 ### Token Checksum

 The token checksum is the hashed value of your voter token. And a server secret, so that only the
 server is able to create valid checksums.




     Voter =request=> Voter Token =hashed=> Voter's Checksum =delegatedTo=> Proxies Checksum <= ProxyToken <= Proxy


# REST API

See autogenerated Swagger API doc //TODO:

GET /my/user
GET /my/voterToken/{areaId}

### Assign, edit and remove a proxy

GET /my/proxy/{areaId}                      collect all info about the proxy and delegations in that area
PUT /my/proxy/{areaId}  AssignProxyRequest  Assign (or reassign) a proxy
DELETE /my/proxy/{areaId}                   Remove a proxy in that area

### Being and becoming a proxy onself

GET /my/delegations/{areaId}                       get accepted and requested delegations
PUT /my/delegations/{areaId}/accept?voterToken=... accept delegation requests
PUT /my/delegations/{areaId}/becomePublicProxy     become a public proxy in that area

GET /users/{userId}/publicChecksum         get checksum of public proxy



# Liquido CI build pipeline

## Compile and build

 * Rename `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` to `application.properties` and fill in all necessary passwords.
 * Build `mvn package`
 * Run: `mvn install && mvn run:jetty`

## Docker build

 * Check your database configuration in the default `src/java/resources/application.properties` file
 * If you are on Windows: Start "Docker for Windows" `mvn dockerfile:build`

## Run docker container

 * `docker run -p 8080:8080 org.doogie/liquido-backend-spring`
   will create and start a docker container and expose port 8080. Check that no other process is already running on that port!
 * Reconnect to logs of an already running container: `docker logs -f [CONTAINER_ID]`

## Docker commands on WIN

 * `docker ps -a -q | ForEach { docker stop $_ }`  - stop all running containers


## Build a release with maven

 * `mvn release:prepare` -> Enter name for tag (can accept default) and next development version
 *  This will also run all tests. There must not be any uncommitted local changes in your working directory.
 *  This will automatically increment the build number (`mvn buildnumber:create`)




# Testing

## Running all tests

Run the test cases under `srs/test/java` with `mvn test -DloadSampleDB=true`.
Spring Boot will automatically start the test server for you.
Test data is taken from the sample DB.

## Test Data





# Dev Links

 * There is an Swagger API documentation (autogenerated with Springfox) at  http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
 * [H2 DB Web Console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)   JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`   Username: `sa` - no pwd, Driver Class: `org.h2.Driver`    * https://springframework.guru/using-the-h2-database-console-in-spring-boot-with-spring-security/


# Testing

We take testing very seriously in Liquido! There is an automated test suite for backend on unit- and integration level.

### Test data

Tests need data! In theory every test should create its own test data. All tests should be completely independent from each other.
But this is just theory. Once you have a lot of tests in a larger project your test suite simply becomes to slow.
So we need another solution: In Liquido there is a dedicated `TestDataCreator.java`. It relies on a set of fixed test data in
`TestFixtures.java`. When the tests run for the first time, then TestDataCreator create all necessary test data from scratch
and it exports the database schema and the testdata as a SQL script. In following test runs, that can quickly be imported
back into the database.  

To re-create all testdata run the backend with the following environment variables. BE CAREFULL: This will delete and kill your whole DB!!!

    -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -DrecreateTestData=true -Dspring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create

From then on all tests can be run against this pre-created test data. This is fast!

    -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -DloadTestData=true     -Dspring.jpa.hibernate-ddl-auto=none

### Testing against production environment

After a deployment you should run tests against your production environment. You may do this manually. Liquido
offers the possibility to run the automated end-2-end tests against PROD. When DevRestController.java is deployed
then you can fetch a JWT like this. You MUST pass the devLoginSmsToken that is configured in appplication-prod.properties 

    http://{PROD_HOST}:{PROD_API_PORT}/liquido/v2/dev/getJWT?mobile=%2B491234567890&token=<devLoginSmsToken>



# Logging

"I am a logging fanatic"

 - REST requests are logged via DoogiesRequestLogger
 - Services methods have entry and exit logging on TRACE level.
 - All writing methods log an INFO
