# Spring Backend for my Liquido WebApp

This is a more technical guide for developers

## Process Model from an idea to a Law

 - At first there is an short rough idea. (NEW_IDEA)
 - When an idea reaches its quorum, then it becomes a proposal. (NEW_PROPOSAL)
 - Alternative proposals can be added to that initial proposal. (NEW_PROPOSAL)
   But they first need to reach a certain quorum too, before they can be voted upon.
 - Each proposal can be discussed. Comments can be voted up and down. (ELABORATION)
 - n days after the initial proposal reached its quorum, then the voting phase starts.
   All competing proposals can be voted upon. (VOTING_PHASE)
 - The winning proposal becomes a law (LAW) and all other proposals are (DECLINED)

## Wording

"idea"          := rough and short
"proposal"      := reached its quorum
"law"           := won a vote


## Backlog / User Stories

## Global configuration / settings

   - number of likes that are necessary to move an idea onto the table
   - number of supporters that are necessary for a proposal to reach its quorum

## "Profile" default values for new polls

  - when does a voting phase / poll start
    a) n days after the initial proposal reached its quorum
    b) when there are at least n alternative proposals (with quorum each)
    c) manually started by the admin
  - duration of elaboration phase
  - duration of voting phase

### Ideas

 - I "Like to discuss" an idea
 - Move an idea onto the table when the necessary quorum is reached.

### Laws

 - Edit the description of a law proposal
 - Add a suggestion to a law
 - Up/Down-vote a suggestion.
 - Sort competing proposals into vote order (XXL)

 ### Voter Token

 A voter token is the digital representation of your right to vote.
 You can request a voter token for every area.

 You need a voterToken to
  - cast your vote
  - check for an existing ballot in a given poll
  - assign, edit or remove a proxy
  - accept delegation requests
  - become a public proxy
  - get number of real delegations to your checksum

Get proxy info for an area is possible without a voterToken


 ### Token Checksum

 The token checksum is the hashed value of your voter token. And a server secret, so that only the
 server is able to create valid checksums.




     Voter =request=> Voter Token =hashed=> Voter's Checksum =delegatedTo=> Proxies Checksum <= ProxyToken <= Proxy


# REST API

See autogenerated Swagger API doc //TODO:

GET /my/user
GET /my/voterToken/{areaId}

### Assign, edit and remove a proxy

GET /my/proxy/{areaId}                      collect all info about the proxy and delegations in that area
PUT /my/proxy/{areaId}  AssignProxyRequest  Assign (or reassign) a proxy
DELETE /my/proxy/{areaId}                   Remove a proxy in that area

### Being and becoming a proxy onself

GET /my/delegations/{areaId}                       get accepted and requested delegations
PUT /my/delegations/{areaId}/accept?voterToken=... accept delegation requests
PUT /my/delegations/{areaId}/becomePublicProxy     become a public proxy in that area

GET /users/{userId}/publicChecksum         get checksum of public proxy



# Liquido CI build pipeline

## Compile and build

 * Rename `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` to `application.properties` and fill in all necessary passwords.
 * Build `mvn package`
 * Run: `mvn install && mvn run:jetty`

## Docker build

 * Check your database configuration in the default `src/java/resources/application.properties` file
 * If you are on Windows: Start "Docker for Windows" `mvn dockerfile:build`

## Run docker container

 * `docker run -p 8080:8080 org.doogie/liquido-backend-spring`
   will create and start a docker container and expose port 8080. Check that no other process is already running on that port!
 * Reconnect to logs of an already running container: `docker logs -f [CONTAINER_ID]`

## Docker commands on WIN

 * `docker ps -a -q | ForEach { docker stop $_ }`  - stop all running containers


## Build a release with maven

 * `mvn release:prepare` -> Enter name for tag (can accept default) and next development version
 *  This will also run all tests. There must not be any uncommitted local changes in your working directory.
 *  This will automatically increment the build number (`mvn buildnumber:create`)




# Testing

## Running all tests

Run the test cases under `srs/test/java` with `mvn test -DloadSampleDB=true`.
Spring Boot will automatically start the test server for you.
Test data is taken from the sample DB.

## Test Data

Test data can be created with `TestDataCreator`. BE CAREFULL: This will delete and kill your whole DB!!!

    -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -DcreateSampleData=true -Dspring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create

Then all tests can be run against this test data by passing the environemtn variable

    -DloadSampleDB=true





# Dev Links

 * There is an Swagger API documentation (autogenerated with Springfox) at  http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
 * [H2 DB Web Console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)   JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`   Username: `sa` - no pwd, Driver Class: `org.h2.Driver`    * https://springframework.guru/using-the-h2-database-console-in-spring-boot-with-spring-security/


# Logging

"I am a logging fanatic"

 - REST requests are logged via DoogiesRequestLogger
 - Services methods have entry and exit logging on TRACE level.
 - All writing methods log an INFO
