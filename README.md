# Liquido-backend-spring

RESTfull backend for my Liquid Democracy application
written in JAVA with Spring Boot and Spring-Data-REST HATEOAS

This project is my playground for learning Spring. :-) 

## Configuration

Rename `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` to `application.properties` and fill in all necessary passwords.

## Build & Run

Use maven:  'mvn install && mvn run:jetty'

## Test

Run the test cases under `srs/test/java` with `mvn test`.
Spring Boot will automatically start the test server for you.

Test data is automatically created by the `TestDataCreator.java`.

## API Documentation

There is an Swagger API documentation (autogenerated with Springfox) at 

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
