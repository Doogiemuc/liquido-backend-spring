# Liquido-backend-spring

Since more than 4 years this is now my personal hobby project.
It has grown larger than I could have ever imagined. Countless 
coding nights have been invested into this project.
Completely beeing "in the FLOW" is an unforgettable state of
mind that only real coders know. HAVE PHUN!
